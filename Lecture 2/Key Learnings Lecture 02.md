# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

This lecture, delivered by David Malan, is an introduction to programming with Python, focusing on the concept of **conditional statements**.

This lecture provides an introduction to programming with Python, with a specific focus on **conditional statements**. These statements are a fundamental aspect of Python, allowing programmers to ask and answer questions within their code, thereby determining which lines of code are executed. 

The lecture delves into Python's built-in syntax for posing these questions, including various symbols used for mathematical comparisons such as:

- Greater than (`>`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)

It also clarifies the use of the equal sign (`=`) for assignment rather than equality, with the latter being represented by two equal signs (`==`). Additionally, the lecture covers the symbol for 'not equal to' (`!=`). 

To utilize these symbols and others for asking questions, the lecture mentions the need for another Python keyword, which is not specified in the excerpt.

## Key Learnings

- The lecture is an introduction to programming with Python, focusing on conditionals.
- Conditionals, or conditional statements, allow you to ask and answer questions in your code, deciding which lines of code to execute.
- Python has built-in syntax for asking questions, including several symbols for mathematical comparisons.
- The equal sign (`=`) is used for assignment, not equality. To compare two things for equality, Python uses two equal signs (`==`).
- The symbol for not equal to is an exclamation point followed by an equal sign (`!=`).
- To ask questions using these symbols, or any others, you will need to use another keyword in Python (not specified in the excerpt).



## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in Python, as in other languages, provide the ability to ask and answer questions within your code. This ability allows you to decide which lines of code to execute, effectively enabling you to take logical "forks in the road" within your code.

## Python's Built-in Syntax

Python comes with a lot of built-in syntax to facilitate decision-making in your code. This includes several symbols used for asking mathematical questions:

- Greater than (`>`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)

## Equality and Assignment

In Python, a single equal sign (`=`) is used for assignment, not for equality. It represents the assignment of values from right to left. To compare two things for equality, Python uses two equal signs (`==`). This distinction is crucial when writing and reading Python code.

## Not Equal To

The symbol for 'not equal to' in Python is an exclamation point followed by an equal sign (`!=`). This allows you to compare two things and execute code if they are not equal.

## Python Keywords

To ask questions using these symbols, or any others, you will need to use specific keywords in Python. The lecture mentions the need for another Python keyword, which is not specified in the excerpt, but it's important to note that Python has several keywords that are used in conjunction with these symbols to ask questions and control the flow of the program.
