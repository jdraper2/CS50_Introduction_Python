# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python: Lecture 04

This lecture, part of CS50's introduction to programming with Python, is presented by David Malan and focuses on the concept of exceptions. Exceptions in programming languages, including Python, refer to problems or errors in the code. The lecture demonstrates how these exceptions occur and how they can be identified and resolved. Using the example of a simple Python program written in VS Code, Malan intentionally introduces a syntax error to illustrate how Python identifies and reports such issues. The lecture emphasizes the importance of correct syntax in programming, drawing parallels with syntax in human languages.

## Key Learnings
The lecture is an introduction to programming with Python, specifically focusing on exceptions. Key Learnings:
- Exceptions in Python and other programming languages refer to problems in the code.
- When something is exceptional in a program, it means something has gone wrong that needs to be solved.
- The lecturer demonstrates an example of an exception by writing a simple Python program in VS Code.
- The program is supposed to print "hello, world" but the lecturer intentionally leaves out a closing quote to create a syntax error.
- When the lecturer runs the program, Python throws a syntax error because of the missing quote.
- The lecturer explains that a syntax error is a problem with the code's syntax, similar to how human languages have syntax.
- The error message "unterminated string literal" is a bit arcane but it indicates that a string literal is not properly closed in the code.

## 1. Introduction to Exceptions in Python

- The lecture is part of CS50's introduction to programming with Python, presented by David Malan.
- The focus of this week's lecture is on exceptions, which refer to problems or errors in the code.
- An exception in a program doesn't mean something good; it indicates that something has gone wrong that needs to be resolved.

## 2. Demonstration of a Syntax Error

- Malan opens up VS Code and creates a new Python file, hello.py.
- He writes a simple line of code to print "hello, world" but intentionally leaves out a closing quote to create a syntax error.
- He then attempts to run the program in the terminal, which results in a syntax error.

## 3. Understanding Syntax Errors

- A syntax error is a problem with the code's syntax, similar to how human languages have syntax.
- The error message "unterminated string literal" indicates that a string literal (a sequence of characters) is not properly closed in the code.
- Although the error message may seem arcane, it provides valuable information about what went wrong in the code.
